##### User Enviroment
_The user environment represents the physical, social, and technological context of the user. This section is used to answer questions like: What technological devices do users have access to? Do they spend most of their time in a corporate office or a home office? And how often do they collaborate with others?_

##### Psychographics
_Psychographics include details such as attitudes, interests, motivations, and pain points. Overall, the demographic profile adds an additional layer of realism to a user persona, boosting empathy when exploring user needs and goals._


### End goals
_The end goal is the motivating factor that inspires action, and answers the question: what do users want or need to accomplish by using your product? End goals are the main driving forces of your users and determine what the persona wants or needs to fulfill._

### Scenarios
_A scenario is a “day-in-the-life” narrative that describes how a persona would interact with your product in a particular context to achieve his or her end goal(s). The scenario usually defines when, where, and how the narrative takes place. They are typically written from the perspective of the persona and describe use cases that may happen in the future._
