## Scenario Template


> User scenario is a detailed description of what users do with the product and more importantly why they do it.

> Scenarios are longer and more informative than a user story.

> Keep the scenarios as close to reality as possible,

> Very detaild

A user scenario is the fictitious story of a user’s accomplishing an action or goal via a product. It focuses on a user’s motivations, and documents the process by which the user might use a design. User scenarios help designers understand what motivates users when they interact with a design – a useful consideration for ideation and usability testing.

Scenarios describe the stories and context behind why a specific user or user group comes to your site.  They note the goals and questions to be achieved and sometimes define the possibilities of how the user(s) can achieve them on the site.

Scenarios are critical both for designing an interface and for usability testing.

### What to Consider When Writing Scenarios
Good scenarios are concise but answer the following key questions:
- Who is the user? Use the personas that have been developed to reflect the real, major user groups coming to your site.
- Why does the user come to the site?  Note what motivates the user to come to the site and their expectations upon arrival, if any.
- What goals does he/she have? Through task analysis, you can better understand the what the user wants on your site and therefore what the site must have for them to leave satisfied.

### When Should Scenario Mapping Be Used in a Project?
Scenario mapping can be effective at many points during a project but there are three great uses for it at specific stages:
- Ideation – if you’re trying to create a new product, then having scenario maps makes it very easy to explore ideas with your team and with users. It also helps, in a similar means to task analysis, formulate a shared vision for the project. (See the method below as to how to do this).
- Iteration – if you’re new to a product and you’re going to be involved in creating future iterations then it’s pretty easy to create scenario maps “on the fly” by observing users with the current product. (This can be done solo and doesn’t need the method below).
- Usability testing – user scenarios can also be used to define which are the most important areas to test during usability testing and to provide guidance on how it should be done.

### Example:
A perfect user scenario comes in a way of a short story that clearly defines the context in which the [product/problem] is used.

Some question to answer:
- Who is the user of our product?
- What does this user want to accomplish with our product?
- How is this user going to achieve her goals?
- Why does this user choose our product over other available options?
- _Many many more questions. This is dependent on your problem_
